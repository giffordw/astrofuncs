def median_absolute_deviation(a, axis=None):
    """Compute the median absolute deviation.

    Returns the median absolute deviation (MAD) of the array elements.
    The MAD is defined as ``median(abs(a - median(a)))``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array or object that can be converted to an array.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the medians are computed. The default (axis=None)
        is to compute the median along a flattened version of the array.

    Returns
    -------
    median_absolute_deviation : ndarray
        A new array holding the result. If the input contains
        integers, or floats of smaller precision than 64, then the output
        data-type is float64.  Otherwise, the output data-type is the same
        as that of the input.

    Examples
    --------

    This will generate random variates from a Gaussian distribution and return
    the median absolute deviation for that distribution::

        >>> from astropy.stats import median_absolute_deviation
        >>> from numpy.random import randn
        >>> randvar = randn(10000)
        >>> mad = median_absolute_deviation(randvar)

def biweight_location(a, c=6.0, M=None):
    """Compute the biweight location for an array.

    Returns the biweight location for the array elements.
    The biweight is a robust statistic for determining the central
    location of a distribution.

    The biweight location is given by the following equation

    .. math::

        C_{bl}= M+\\frac{\Sigma_{\|u_i\|<1} (x_i-M)(1-u_i^2)^2}

    where MAD is the median absolute deviation.

    Parameters
    ----------
